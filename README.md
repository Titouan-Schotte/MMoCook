# MMo Cook

Mod including a mini game system to obtain good or bad quality food.
-> This mod is entirely inspired by the Genshin Impact system.

## How does it work ?

You just need to place the campfire included in the mod blocks to have access (by right clicking on it) to a graphical interface.

This will show you:

You can notice that by putting your mouse over the desired food, a small window will display the ingredients necessary for its conception + the side effects that this food will give you.

Once all the ingredients have been collected, you can then select the desired food to cook it:

A speed mini-game will then start:
You will need to press the STOP button when the animated cursor reaches the orange / red area (depending on the difficulty of designing the food the color and size of the area will vary).

If you click on the "STOP" button when the cursor is in the gray area, then you will get low quality food.

Conversely, if you manage to stop the cursor while it is in the orange / red zone, you will obtain "premium" food with side effects (or not).
